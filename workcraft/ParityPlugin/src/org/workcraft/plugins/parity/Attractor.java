 * Fixed point attractor class.

 * Parity Game Wikipedia page, under the subtitle
 * 'Recursive algorithm for solving parity games'.
 * There is also a solid explanation found on page 5 of:
 * 'Graph games with perfect information' by Dietmar Berwanger.
 *
 * Although this generates the set of reachable states for some set of target
 * states F, this is extended to parity by treating vertices with a given value
 * as said target states and then calculating the fixed point attractor for such
